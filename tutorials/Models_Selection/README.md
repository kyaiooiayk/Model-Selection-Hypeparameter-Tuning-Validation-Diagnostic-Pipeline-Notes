# Methods Selection
*List of notebooks/templates focused on methods. Essentially how you pick a method over another. This is NOT models selection, where models are here understood as different version of the same method. For models selection see `Hyperparameters_Tuning`*

## A note on the notebook rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this):
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black& white. These are placed in the folder named `GitHub_MD_rendering` where MD stands for MarkDown.
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in coloured.
